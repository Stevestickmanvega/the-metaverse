Game Components
The game consists of the following components:

VirtualWorld: This is the main class that manages the players, robots, tasks, jobs, and the machine learning model.
Player: This class represents each player in the game. A player has a name, tasks, jobs, reward, and data.
Robot: This class represents each robot in the game. A robot has a name and can execute commands.
Task: This class represents each task in the game. A task has a name and a reward.
Job: This class represents each job in the game. A job has a name and a reward.
Machine Learning
The game uses a random forest classifier from scikit-learn to learn the actions of each player. The model is trained on the player's state (number of tasks, number of jobs, and reward), action (assign task, assign job, or control robot), and reward. The model predicts the best action for each player given their current state. The model is updated and retrained after each iteration of the game.

Future Work
Add more complex states and actions for the machine learning model.
Allow players to select their own tasks and jobs.
Add more robots and allow players to control multiple robots.
